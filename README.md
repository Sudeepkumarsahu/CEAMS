CEAMS is a centralized system designed to streamline the management of environmental, academic, and administrative data within an institution. The project focuses on integrating different modules like student management, faculty management, course records, and environmental compliance data into one centralized platform. The aim was to reduce redundancy, improve data accuracy, and provide easy access to information for decision-making.
